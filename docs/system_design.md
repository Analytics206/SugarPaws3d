# 🧩 SugarPaws3D - System Design Document

This document outlines the system architecture for the SugarPaws3D project, including the current static site setup and future enhancements.

---

## 📦 Phase 1: Static Marketing Site (Current)

**Overview**  
A fully static website to showcase 3D models and direct users to Patreon for membership.

**Architecture**

User → Browser → Static HTML/CSS/JS (hosted on GoDaddy)
↑
Generated by → Next.js Static Export (out/)


**Components**
- `Next.js` handles page routing and static export.
- `Tailwind CSS` is used for fast, responsive styling.
- `models.json` provides lightweight data for the gallery.
- Hosted via **GoDaddy** as a simple file server (`out/` directory).

**Pages**
- `/` – Home with model previews and Patreon CTA.
- `/models` – Gallery page.
- `/contact` – Simple contact info or form.
- `/about` – Creator background and mission.

## 🚧 Phase 2: Interactive Site (Planned 6–12 Months)

**Goals**
- Membership login (Google/Microsoft OAuth)
- Paid access to premium models (via Stripe or Patreon API)
- User dashboards and model management
- Optional CMS for content and model listings

**Proposed Architecture**



User → Browser
→ Frontend (Next.js + API routes or hosted backend)
→ Auth Service (OAuth)
→ Payments (Stripe/Patreon API)
→ Content API (optional CMS or Headless DB)

**New Components**
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 (Google, Microsoft) via NextAuth or Firebase Auth
- **Payments:** Stripe Checkout / Patreon Membership Tiers
- **Backend (optional):**
  - Vercel serverless functions or custom Express/Node server
  - CMS like Sanity/Strapi or custom model DB
- **Hosting Upgrade:** Vercel or Netlify for CI/CD and HTTPS

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Store no sensitive data in Phase 1
- Use HTTPS with OAuth/payment providers
- Implement rate limiting & spam protection in Phase 2 (e.g., form validation, ReCAPTCHA)

---

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

| Phase      | Hosting       | Traffic Ready For      |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Phase 1    | GoDaddy (static) | Low to moderate        |
| Phase 2+   | Vercel/Netlify | High, global CDN support |

---

## ✅ Summary

- Minimal complexity for MVP launch
- Stack supports growth without major rewrites
- Modular design to integrate auth, payments, and CMS as needed
