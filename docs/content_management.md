Yes, you can absolutely add admin content management capabilities to your current Next.js + static site frameworkâ€”even with static export (output: 'export')â€”but with some architecture considerations depending on how dynamic you want it to be.

âœ… Your Goal
Let admins upload photos of 3D models and update descriptions without redeploying the site.

ðŸ’¡ Options for Adding Admin Content Management
1. Use a Headless CMS (Recommended)
Add a CMS that stores your model data (images, descriptions) externally, and fetch it dynamically:

CMS	Pros	Notes
Sanity	Flexible schema, real-time updates	Free tier available
Contentful	Popular, visual UI	Limited free tier
Strapi (self-hosted)	Full control, open source	Requires backend or Docker
Directus (self-hosted)	Visual, modern, open source	Also Docker-ready

Youâ€™d:

Add a /admin route (or a separate site) for login + upload/edit.

Use their APIs to fetch data in your Next.js frontend.

No need to redeploy: content updates instantly.

2. Use Google Sheets + Image Uploader
This is a quick and simple hack:

Store model data (name, description, image URL) in a Google Sheet.

Use a Google Drive or Imgur-style uploader.

Use getServerSideProps or getStaticProps + revalidation to pull data into your site.

Great for MVPs or low-traffic sites.

3. Lightweight Custom Admin Panel + JSON Store
If you prefer full control:

Build a /admin panel in your app (auth required).

Upload images to a cloud bucket (e.g. Cloudinary or AWS S3).

Store model metadata in a hosted JSON file, a NoSQL DB (like Firebase or Supabase), or a Git-backed CMS like Netlify CMS.

Youâ€™d still avoid redeploys, but itâ€™s more complex to maintain.

ðŸ›  Technical Notes
Static Export Sites (output: 'export') donâ€™t allow dynamic content easilyâ€”use getStaticProps with revalidate or move to next start if you want server rendering.

If you plan to stay on GoDaddy, full server-side functionality is limitedâ€”you may need to move to Vercel, Render, or a VPS (later).

ðŸ”’ Admin Access & Auth
You can add simple auth via:

Firebase Auth

Clerk/Auth0

Google Sign-In only (easy to manage)

Then protect routes like /admin and allow upload/edit only for logged-in users.
