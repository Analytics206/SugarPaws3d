## âœ… Adjusted Plan: Static-Exported Next.js Site for GoDaddy
### ðŸ”§ Updated Stack (Phase 1: Static Deployment)
- Framework: Next.js â€“ using next export to generate static HTML
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Content: Markdown (MDX), JSON, or hardcoded components
- Deployment Target: Exported HTML, deployed via FTP to GoDaddy
- Command: next export creates out/ folder ready for upload

## Build & Deploy Instructions
- Set up your project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest sugarpaws3d --app --typescript --tailwind
```
## Update next.config.js to allow static export

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // needed for static export if using <Image>
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```


## Build the static site

```bash
npm run build
npm run export

```
* This will output a out/ directory with static HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Upload to GoDaddy
- Use FTP or GoDaddyâ€™s file manager
- Upload everything in the out/ folder to your site's public directory (public_html/)

* Deploy to GoDaddy
