## 🧭 Future Stack Considerations (6–12 months)
```yaml


| Feature Area       | Tech Option(s) Considered                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication     | OAuth (Google, Microsoft) via Auth providers     |
| Payments           | Stripe or Patreon API                            |
| CMS/Model Management | Headless CMS (e.g. Sanity, Strapi) (optional)    |
| Hosting Upgrade    | Vercel, Netlify, or VPS with CI/CD                |
| SEO & Analytics    | Next SEO, Google Analytics                        |
| Containerization  | Docker Desktop, Docker Compose                    |

---

## 🐳 Containerization (Phase 1)

- Orchestration: Docker Compose v2
- Runtime Images: `node:22-slim` (dev), `nginx:1.27-alpine` (prod)
- Dev Service: `web` runs Next.js dev server on port 3000 with live reload
- Prod Service: `web_prod` serves static export (`out/`) on port 8080 via Nginx
- Host: Windows with Docker Desktop (WSL 2 backend recommended)
- Reverse Proxy: Nginx Proxy Manager (admin UI on port 81; public 80/443). MariaDB-backed with named volumes (`npm_data`, `npm_letsencrypt`, `npm_db`). Upstream target for the app: `http://web:3000` on the shared `sugarpaws_net` network.

---

## ✅ Goals

- Keep stack simple for static marketing site phase
- Plan forward for user auth and secure payment integration
- Remain open to migration from GoDaddy to modern deployment platforms

---

## ✅ Adjusted Plan: Static-Exported Next.js Site for GoDaddy
### 🔧 Updated Stack (Phase 1: Static Deployment)
- Framework: Next.js – using next export to generate static HTML
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Content: Markdown (MDX), JSON, or hardcoded components
- Deployment Target: Exported HTML, deployed via FTP to GoDaddy
- Command: next export creates out/ folder ready for upload

## Build & Deploy Instructions
- Set up your project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest sugarpaws3d --app --typescript --tailwind
```
## Update next.config.js to allow static export

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true, // needed for static export if using <Image>
  },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```


## Build the static site

```bash
npm run build
npm run export

```
* This will output a out/ directory with static HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Upload to GoDaddy
- Use FTP or GoDaddy's file manager
- Upload everything in the out/ folder to your site's public directory (public_html/)

* Deploy to GoDaddy


# future tech stack

📦 Later Migration Path (Optional)
When you're ready to move beyond GoDaddy:

Deploy on Vercel or Render for full Next.js capabilities (auth, serverless functions, etc.)

Use your GoDaddy domain by pointing DNS to Vercel

✅ Updated Stack Recommendation: Marketing-First, Scalable Later
🔧 Tech Stack (Phase 1 – Marketing Website)
Framework: Next.js (with App Router) – supports both static and dynamic content; ideal for future upgrades

Styling: Tailwind CSS – fast, clean, and responsive UI

Hosting: Vercel – one-click deploy, optimized for Next.js

Content: Use MDX files or JSON for 3D model listings, or optionally a headless CMS like Sanity or Notion API

Links to Patreon: Simple CTA buttons or card links per model/section

🛠 Phase 1 Capabilities (Now)
Static website showcasing 3D models (with image previews)

Model pages or gallery views

About, contact, and FAQs

Link to Patreon for exclusive access

🌱 Phase 2 Ready (6–12 Months Later)
Add NextAuth.js for Google/Microsoft login

Add Stripe for subscriptions/memberships

Add user dashboard for members

Lock content or downloads behind authentication


✅ Suggested Tools for Phase 1
Feature	Tool / Stack
Static Pages	Next.js App Router
Styling	Tailwind CSS
Model Listings	JSON or MDX-based gallery
Patreon Integration	Link buttons, CTA cards
Hosting	Vercel (free tier is great)

Start building:

Home page with a banner and brief description

Grid of 3D model thumbnails with links

Each model links to a larger preview and a Patreon CTA

Add "About", "Contact", and "Support Us" sections

💡 Summary
You’re setting yourself up for success:

Lightweight today: simple and fast to build and deploy

Scalable tomorrow: authentication and payment ready without tech debt

Polished: Tailwind + Next.js = modern and responsive design


✅ Summary
Current Goal	Solution
Run on GoDaddy	Use next export to generate static site
Build simple marketing site	Next.js + Tailwind
Plan for future login & payments	Keep Next.js; migrate later to Vercel or similar
Content delivery + Patreon links	Static pages with CTAs
