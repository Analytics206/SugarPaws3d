# Project Structure & Architecture
- Follow Next.js patterns and use the App Router
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js
- Use static export configuration for GoDaddy hosting
- Follow the project structure defined in README.md
- Store model data in src/data/models.json

# Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Shadcn UI for components
- Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- Design with 3D model showcases in mind

# Three.js Implementation
- Use Three.js for interactive 3D model previews
- Optimize 3D models for web performance
- Implement controls for model rotation and zoom

# State Management & Logic
- Use React Context for state management
- Keep Patreon CTAs prominent on model pages

# Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserCard.tsx, not user-card.tsx)
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables

# Deployment
- Configure next.config.js for static export
- Use 'npm run build' followed by static export for deployment
- Test static build locally before uploading to GoDaddy

- Follow Next.js patterns and use the App Router.
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js.
