# Project Structure & Architecture# General
- All services should run in docker containers excepts MS SQL Server
- You are a software engineer who specializes in JavaScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- You are a website developer who specializes in creating professional websites
- SugarPaws3D is a platform for showcasing 3D models for 3D printing
- Feature flags and configuration settings are in src/config
- Follow the Airbnb Style Guide for code formatting
- Do not give me code snippets, only the final full code
- Always use best practices for code quality and maintainability
- Update docs/release_notes.md when you complete a new release or new feature
- Update docs/systemdesign.md when you complete a new feature
- Update docs/tech_stack.md when you use a new library or tool
- Developer is always working from a venv environment with powershell commands
- Do not delete or remove features unless specified by the user
- If you break a feature, roll back change and fix it
- Do not create fake database connection strings or fake API connections
- If you break a database connection string to database, roll back change and fix it
- Do not create fake API responses

## Technology Stack
- Use Python 3.12-slim as the primary programming language for data science and machine learning
- Use Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration
- Use MongoDB for document storage
- Use Neo4j for graph database representation
- Use Qdrant for vector embeddings storage and semantic search
- Use PyTorch for deep learning and embedding generation (with GPU support)
- Use NumPy for numerical computing and array operations
- Use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring
- Use latest React 18.2 for the web user interface
- Use latest NEXT.js 15.4 for the web user interface
- Use Node.js 22-slim
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Web UI should be compatible with Chrome as a priority, then Firefox, then Edge, then Safari

# Project Structure & Architecture
- Follow Next.js patterns and use the App Router
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js
- Use static export configuration for GoDaddy hosting
- Follow the project structure defined in README.md
- Store model data in src/data/models.json

# Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
- Design with 3D model showcases in mind

# Three.js Implementation
- Use Three.js for interactive 3D model previews
- Optimize 3D models for web performance
- Implement controls for model rotation and zoom

# State Management & Logic
- Use React Context for state management
- Keep Patreon CTAs prominent on model pages

# Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserCard.tsx, not user-card.tsx)
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables

# Deployment
- Configure next.config.js for static export
- Use 'npm run build' followed by static export for deployment in docker container
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js
